## Mission Brief

This repository serves as the central command for my personal homelab infrastructure. It's a highly classified initiative to automate and manage all digital assets within my private domain. Think of it as the "Skunkworks" for my home network, meticulously designed for precision and control.

## Operational Overview

`project-terminus` leverages Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles to ensure a consistent, repeatable, and robust homelab environment. Key technologies currently under its purview include:

*   **Ansible:** For orchestration and configuration management across various systems.
*   **Proxmox:** For virtualized environments and container management.

This project is a living document of my homelab's evolution, capturing the exact state and configuration of all components. It's built for personal deployment and management, ensuring my digital infrastructure operates with atomic-age reliability.
